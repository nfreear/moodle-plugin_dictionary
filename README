Popup Dictionary plugin
=======================

Patrick Thibaudeau's "Pop up Dictionary" filter/block plugin for Moodle 1.8 or later (currently not 2.0).

A code-repository does not appear to be at http://cvs.moodle.org or elsewhere. 
(A short-term fork, I hope!)

Installation
------------
* See, http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=1751

TODO
----
* Prevent the PHP notices in Moodle developer mode.
* Usability and accessibility improvements.
* Make installation easier, so you don't have to copy to filter and blocks directories.
* Port to Moodle 2.0.
* Merge with the 'official' code/ download, wherever it is.
